# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
There are four pillors of OOP.
- Abstraction
- Encapsulatio
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## Abstraction
Abstract classes in Dart are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. Note: Abstract methods are those methods that don't have any implementation. It should also be noted that a class in Dart can be declared abstract using the "abstract" keyword followed by the class declaration

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism that confirms critical and sensitive data which is hidden from users. To achieve encapsulation, you can make fields private and use the public getter and setter method to access and set the value of that field.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the concept of OOP, where one thing has various possible forms. The idea of the same thing having different shapes, sizes, and features distinguishes it from others. It reduces the time and effort to write repetitive code and provides you with the flexibility to override.

## Inheritence
Inheritance in dart is defined as the process in which one class derive the properties and characteristics of another class. It is helpful as it provides an ability with which we can create a new class from an existing class.
